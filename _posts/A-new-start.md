I can't promise that these posts will be anything amazing. They are however a very low touch method for me to keep track of different projects I'm working on and most importantly to act as a notebook. Not everything I post will be polished, but I do hope that they'll be very specific to key points I'm still trying to understand or simply just often forget.

Let's go!
