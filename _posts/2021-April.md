#### Ideas/Thoughts

- PixelCloud for Figma\
   Steph Engle shared a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/Soengle/status/1378046573351858178) explaing how PixelCloud (similar to Wake... a feed of screenshots of what people are working on, giving the opporunity to comment) was used at FB. An idea using Figma could to be create a plugin which shares either a file or frame to a app where users can comment etc.

</br>

- Sharing Frame from Figma Plugin\
   Similar to [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/), I want to be able to select a frame, use the plugin, and paste. It should place the frame on a neat backgruond, and copy to the clipboard so all I have to do is paste.

</br>

- Lighthouse style onboarding for CF\
  Performance score and security score...

</br>

- An App to delete multiple posts from Instagram\
  The existing apps look terrible and seem to only be available on Android - I wonder what's happening on iOS...

</br>

- An easy way to send payments to anyone with any currency via a username\
  Why isn't it possible using Wise or WorldRemit etc to eaily send money in any currency to a user of the same platform.
