#### Thoughts

- PixelCloud for Figma\
  Steph Engle shared a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/Soengle/status/1378046573351858178) explaing how PixelCloud (similar to Wake... a feed of screenshots of what people are working on, giving the opporunity to comment) was used at FB. An idea using Figma could to be create a plugin which shares either a file or frame to a app where users can comment etc.
