#### Thoughts

- PixelCloud for Figma\
  Steph Engle shared a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/Soengle/status/1378046573351858178) explaing how PixelCloud (similar to Wake... a feed of screenshots of what people are working on, giving the opporunity to comment) was used at FB. An idea using Figma could to be create a plugin which shares either a file or frame to a app where users can comment etc.

- Sharing Frame from Figma Plugin\
  Similar to x, I want to be able to select a frame, use the plugin, and paste. It should place the frame on a neat backgruond, and copy to the clipboard so all I have to do is paste.

- Lighthouse style onboarding for CF\
  Performance score and security score...
