            <p>
              In March 2014 I started working with Joe Nash, Tim Fogarty and
              Bilawal Hameed on a project to help build a thriving student
              hackathon community in the EU. Mike Swift and Jon Gottfried were
              also trying to solve a similar problem in North America. A couple
              of phone calls, emails and deliberation sessions later, we began
              working together to grow the global student hackathon community.
              Today Major League Hacking helps support over 65,000 students and
              200+ events and has a strong 10+ full time team behind it.{" "}

            <p>
              MLH gave me experience working at a startup from the earliest
              stages all the way through to raising a $1M seed round. The time
              spent has been well worth the positive impact and growth of the
              student hacker community.
